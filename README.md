# PROJEKT-DESIGN-SHOP


This project is an online shop with a sleek design (two colors and one font), built in vanilla js, html and css.
Simple hover effects and a CSS focus “display grid” for symmetrical arrangement of the elements.
The project is also “responsive”, i.e. suitable for mobile devices.
As an example, the dimensions were chosen 414px x 896px (here iPhone XR).
